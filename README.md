# Weather Wizard
This project is composed by a neural network tool that concludes in a human readable way a reflection of "vehicle to be used to go outside" versus "current daily weather condition".

The decision is made based in many weather information through OpenWeather API.
The final user can have an AI opinion about the current weather of the day and how his vehicle choice will be affected when going and returning from home.
